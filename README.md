# Handwriting-Recognition-using-Linear-and-Logistic-Regression
This code addresses how we could identify the similarity between two handwritten samples using Linear regression, Logistic regression and Tensorflow methodologies. If the algorithm detects a match, then 1 is returned and similarily  0 is returned if there is dissimilarity between the two images. Though the results are scalar and discrete (0,1), we consider linear/logistic regression and tensorflow to obtain continuous value rather than a discrete on, to find the percent of match.
